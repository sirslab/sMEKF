## Description
Estimating the limbs pose in a wearable way may beneﬁt multiple areas such as rehabilitation, teleoperation, human-robot interaction, gaming, and many more. Several solutions are commercially available, but they are usually expensive or not wearable/portable. We present a wearable low-cost approach, based on inertial measurements units (IMUs), for motion analysis and body tracking. Differently from camerabased approaches, the proposed system does not suffer from occlusion problems and lighting conditions, it is cost effective and it can be used in indoor and outdoor environments. Moreover, since only accelerometers and gyroscopes are used to estimate the orientation, the system can be used also in the presence of iron and magnetic disturbances. An experimental validation usingahighprecisionopticaltrackerhasbeenperformed.Results conﬁrmed the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
